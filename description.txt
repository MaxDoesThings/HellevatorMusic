Welcome to the Terraria description of the mod.

There is nothing to see here.
Maybe except that you can check out the config to change stuff.
Other than that? Literally nothing else.
Go fall in a hole (or hellevator; enjoy the music).

Okay I lied, here's a changelog in-game (there's also one in the steam page too y'know...)

-----Changelog-----

__1.0.0 (5/24/25)__
Initial release!

__1.0.1 (5/25/25)__
- Bumped the minimum time until music plays to be 60 frames (0 frames bugged the music/made it play all the time).
- Music when falling is only valid while underground; below the surface, sky and space, above hell.
- Fixed some wording in the config option tooltips.

__1.1.0 (5/28/25)__
- Added 11 new songs (many good reccomendations/songs I feel ashamaed for missing out on).
- Added more configurability options, including horizontal movement detection for premature music activiation.
- Corrected some tooltips.

For more detailed changes, check the github repo linked on the mod page.
