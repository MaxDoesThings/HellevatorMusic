[h3] Tell me your wares funny man. [/h3]
Ever thought that your Hellevator rides (falls) were missing a little something?
Look no further, because now you can listen to some tunes while you fall down your Hellevator!

[h3] What's it do? [/h3]
After falling for a set amount of time, you'll be greeted [i] NOT [/i] with the usual cavern music, but a random song picked and curated for your enjoyment and falling pleasure.
Don't like it randomly choosing music for you? You can change that and more in the config!

Happy falling y'all. Don't forget to wear a lucky horseshoe.


[h3] Wait! I have a song I think would fit well! [/h3]
Feel free to post any song recommendations in the comments. I'll be sure to check them out and consider adding them to the mod. :luv:
